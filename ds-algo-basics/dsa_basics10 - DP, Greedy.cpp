		- Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again. 

		- two main properties of a problem that suggests that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic programming:
			1) Optimal Substructure
			2) Overlapping Subproblems 
			 
	 Greedy 
	 	- At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem. 

	 	- Applications: 
	 		Activity selection problem
	 		Prim's 
	 		Kruskal
	 		Dijkstra
	 		Huffman coding
